# DBClient
DBclient provides a simple graphical interface to relational databases.
Because it is built using Java, it can access any JDBC-compliant database running on any machine, allowing remote access to multiple databases.

User can:
- easily view and edit data in any JDBC-compliant database,
- view the database’s meta-data,
- work with multiple databases on both local and remote machines,
- use a single, consistent interface to work with different database engines, and
- expand the tool’s capabilities and include DB-specific functionality using plugins.
